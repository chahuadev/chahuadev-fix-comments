## Quality Assurance

These test files are designed to:

1. **Stress Test** the comment fixer with real-world complexity
2. **Validate Accuracy** of function and class detection
3. **Test Edge Cases** with unusual code patterns
4. **Measure Performance** with large files and complex structures
5. **Ensure Reliability** across different programming paradigms

## Best Practices for Testing

### Before Testing
1. **Backup Original Files:** Always keep copies of uncommented versions
2. **Review Output:** Manually inspect generated comments for accuracy
3. **Test Incrementally:** Start with simpler files before complex ones
4. **Validate Syntax:** Ensure the tool doesn't break existing code

### During Testing
1. **Monitor Performance:** Track processing time for large files
2. **Check Coverage:** Verify all functions and classes receive comments
3. **Assess Quality:** Evaluate comment clarity and usefulness
4. **Test Edge Cases:** Try unusual function signatures and patterns

### After Testing
1. **Compare Results:** Check differences between before and after
2. **Validate Functionality:** Ensure original code still works
3. **Review Comments:** Assess generated documentation quality
4. **Report Issues:** Document any problems or improvements needed

## Contributing

If you find issues with these test files or want to add new test scenarios:

1. **Add New Files:** Create additional complex code samples
2. **Report Bugs:** Document any comment fixer issues found
3. **Suggest Improvements:** Recommend better test coverage
4. **Submit Examples:** Provide real-world code samples

## Security Note

These test files contain mock implementations and should **never be used in production environments**. They are designed purely for testing and demonstration purposes.
